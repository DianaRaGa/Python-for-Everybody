# Python for Everybody – Chapter 1 Exercises

## 📘 Introduction

This file contains my answers to the exercises from Chapter 1 of the book  
**"Python for Everybody"** by Dr. Charles Severance (Dr. Chuck).

In this chapter, I explored the basics of programming, what Python is,  
and how scripts are written and executed. These exercises helped me get  
comfortable with Python’s interface and terminology.

## 📝 Exercises

### Exercise 1: What is the function of the secondary memory in a computer?

**Answer:**  
c) Store information for the long term, even beyond a power cycle

---

### Exercise 2: What is a program?

**Answer:**  
A program is a way of solving a problem using a language to take advantage  
of the computer's capacities to do something with data through a series of steps.

---

### Exercise 3: What is the difference between a compiler and an interpreter?

**Answer:**  
A compiler takes the entire code and translates it into machine code before executing it, creating a file that can be run later.  
The interpreter translates the code line by line as it runs, without creating a separate executable file, just like Python does.

### Exercise 4: Which of the following contains “machine code”?

**Answer:**  
c) Python source file

---

### Exercise 5: What is wrong with the following code:

    >>> primt Hello world!
    File "<stdin>", line 1
    primt Hello world!
    ˆ
    SyntaxError: invalid syntax
    >>>

**Answer:**  
The error in the code is the misspelling of the `print` statement and the missing ().  
It should be:  
    >>>print("Hello world!")
That's why it raises a SyntaxError.

### Exercise 6: Where in the computer is a variable such as “x” stored after the following Python line finishes?
**Answer:**  
b) Main Memory

---

### Exercise 7: What will the following program print out?

    >>> x = 43
    >>> x = x - 1
    >>> print(x)

**Answer:**  
b) 42

### Exercise 8: Explain each of the following using an example of a human capability:
(1) Central Processing Unit
(2) Main Memory
(3) Secondary Memory
(4) Input Device
(5) Output Device

**Answer:**  
1. **CPU:** It’s like the brain, it processes and executes instructions, makes decisions, and controls all actions in the body.
2. **RAM (Main Memory):** It’s like short-term memory, remembering a password just long enough to type it in, then forgetting it.
3. **Secondary Memory:** Like a notebook where you store information you want to access later.
4. **Input Device:** Our senses like the eyes, ears, fingers, nose, tongue, all that gather information from the world.
5. **Output Device:** Our hands, mouth, legs, they express or act based on the information we process.

### 🧠 Reflection
Before reading this chapter, I didn’t really know how computers worked internally, and watching the Coursera video 
alongside the book took me by surprise. Seeing how the insides of a computer function felt like discovering something 
completly new, a system that not only works but keeps evolving. It really shifted how I view computers and the work that 
behind them.
One of the challenges I faced was understanding the terminology. I’ve never been great at remembering abstract concepts 
unless I can visualize them. That’s why the last exercise, with the human analogies, was so helpful (even though I 
still had to look things up) it gave me something concrete to hold onto.
Overall, this chapter made me feel more confident about learning Python. The way Dr. Chuck explains things (both in 
the book and in the Coursera videos) is very approachable. His personality really comes through and helps make 
intimidating topics feel much more welcoming and possible to understand.
