# Python for Everybody 🐍

This repository contains my solutions, notes, and exercises from the **Python for Everybody** course by Dr. Charles Severance (a.k.a. Dr. Chuck).

I'm working through the book and accompanying video lectures to build a strong foundation in Python programming.

## 📚 Contents

Each file corresponds to a exercise in each chapter within the book:

## 🚀 What I’m Learning

- Python syntax and structure
- How to write and debug Python programs
- Problem-solving with real-world examples
- Best practices in coding

## 🛠️ Tools

- Python 3.x
- Phoenix Code
- VS Code / Jupyter Notebook
- Git & GitHub for version control

## 📅 Progress

I update this repo as I finish each chapter. Feel free to follow along or use this as a reference if you’re learning too!
